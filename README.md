# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com).

For [AoC 2020](https://github.com/joeygibson/adventofcode2020), I did all my solutions in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Last year,
for [AoC 2021](https://github.com/joeygibson/adventofcode2021), I did them all in [Python](https://www.python.org) (even though I 
dropped out half-way through the month.)

This year, I decided to do them all in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). I've been a fan of Kotlin for years, and have used it
on a few projects, but it's been a while. This should be interesting.
