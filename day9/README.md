# Day 9

I added a crude visualization of part 2. [Here's a recording](https://asciinema.org/a/1kCHqdoJSyW8RkSpUpsWcrzuW) 
of it running, using the "larger example" data from the part 2 section of [the instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9).

Here's the data from that page:

```
R 5
U 8
L 8
D 3
R 17
D 10
L 25
U 20
```
